# VocabBooster backend

It gradually becomes frustrating when you have come across so many words in your life and they are always on the tip of your tongue, but you can't seem to recall them when you need them.
This is where Vocab Booster comes into the picture. Say hi to your personal dictionary that lets you populate new words as and when you come across them. It allows you to add tags so that you 
can keep a track of where you read that word whether it's a TV show, a subreddit, or a book you just started reading. The home page throws you 5 random words each time you refresh it. More functionalities
coming soon but the MVP is already up and running.
